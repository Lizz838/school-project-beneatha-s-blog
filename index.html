        <h2>UUGH MY FAMILY SUCKS!</h2>
        <div class="subtitle">written four weeks ago</div>
        <p>So I wake up this morning, the bathroom was occupied, and already my brother Walter Lee is being a pain. First he complains that I should've gotten up earlier (even though everyone knows he can't even wake himself up) and then he calls me a "horrible-looking chick!" Now I'm feeling a little snappy, so I tell him that I dissected something that looked like him in biology class and move on. We talk a bit about my perfectly rational dream of becoming a doctor- which he <i>obviously</i> disagrees with- and then he moves on to the dreaded subject: the check.</p>
            
        <p>You see, good ol' Papa died a while back, and now Mama's getting an insurance check that'll be enough to cover my medical school costs. But <i>no</i>, Walter would rather spend it on a liquor store! It's all Mama's decision on what we should use it for, but of course, Walter thinks he's the <i>Patriarch</i> of the household and should get to do what he wants with it.</p>

        <p>Exit Walter. Enter Mama. At first she seems a little annoyed at Walter for causing a ruckus, but then I make the mistake of using the "lord's" name in vain. And you know what she does when I tell her I don't believe in god? She slaps me! And makes me say there is a god! What ever happened to freedom of speech in this house? Sometimes I wish I lived alone, where I can be in PEACE!</p>

        <h2>Asagai!</h2>
        <div class="subtitle">written three weeks ago</div>
        <p>My friend Asagai visited today! But of course, the family was being annoying about it. As soon as my Mama heard he's Nigerian she's all on about how she's "never met an African before," asking if it was the same thing as Liberia, generally being a bit of a pain. I tried to tell her not to ask him any ignorant questions, and she responds by saying I shouldn't bring my friends over if I think we're ignorant. Well where else am I supposed to bring them?!</p>
        <p>Ahem. Asagai was just a dear when he came. He was in Canada, you know. He said it was very... Canadian. He's witty like that, you know. He brought me a gift, too: some music records and the dress of a Nigerian woman! I absolutely love it. Though, he did call my hair "mutilated," which was a bit insulting. He also explained his nickname for me: "One For Whom Bread Is Not Enough." Is that supposed to be a compliment, or an insult? I cannot tell. For now I'll take it positively, just because I like him.</p>

        <h2>George and Money</h2>
        <div class="subtitle">written two weeks ago</div>
        <p>So I am supposed to "like" George Murchinson, but I do NOT. He is an assimilationist! And also my boyfriend technically, but he won't be for much longer. Especially when he wants me to be a "simple" girl instead of who I truly am.</p>

        <p>Luckily I have Mama's support with me this time. She says I shouldn't waste my time with no fools.</p>


        <p>Speaking of Mama, I overheard a conversation she had with Walter later the day George came. She told Walter that he can have $3,500 to use as he wishes, after setting aside three thousand for my schooling. I... don't really know what to think?</p>

        <p>I mean, on one hand, I get to go to medical school- yay! But giving the rest to <i>Walter</i>? I would not trust that man with a penny. Something bad's gonna happen, I know it.</p>

        <h2>Walter Ruins Everything</h2>
        <div class="subtitle">written one week ago</div>
        <p>So everything was finally going FINE for once, and Walter ruined it all. We were going to move into that new house the rest of the ten grand was going towards, and the mood at home was like no other. Ruth and Walter even danced! Then this nasty fellow going by the name of Lindner stopped by, saying he was from the neighborhood commitee we were moving into. I immediately knew there was something up with that man, but nobody else seemed to notice it. That is, until he offered for us to sell back the house since we're <i>Black</i> and he's a <i>racist</i>. What a prick! But we told him what's what, that we're not gonna take that stupid offer, and he left.</p>
        
        <p>But that wasn't all. Next comes in Walter's weird friend Bobo, only for him to tell us that Walter basically STOLE all the money and gave it to his friend Willy, who promptly ran off with it. I felt so mad! I still feel mad! Who in their right mind would give away all that cash THAT DOESN'T EVEN BELONG TO HIM to some rando scammer?!</p>

        <p>Everything feels bleak. Walter fooled the whole family, and now we're all at rock bottom. That's just how a loving god wants it, huh?</p>

        <h2>We're gonna make it.</h2>
        <div class="subtitle">written one week ago</div>
        <p>Was I ever truly independent? I mean, that's what Asagai told me when he stopped by. My whole dream hinged on my father dying and leaving us money, and now all that money's gone.</p>
        <p>Regardless. We're going to make it. Walter called Lindner over, said he'll take his deal to get some semblance of money back, but in the end we- the whole family- we stood up and said we're going to move in there. And we are. Today's moving day, and I'm anxious. I don't know what life will be like from now on. Asagai offered that I can live in Nigeria with him, as an alternative. Which path will I take? I genuinely don't know.</p>
        <p>I just know the future will be better.</p>
